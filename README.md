The die we are dealing with is a 6-sided die. 
The Electronic Die is used as opposed to a real die because real die can be “loaded”. 
Loaded die are made so that one number has a higher probability of being chosen. 
For example, a loaded 6-sided die for a 5 would have a higher probability of the 5 being chosen than numbers 1,2,3,4, and 6. 
Instead our die is not loaded and the numbers 1-6 have fair chances of being picked since the function we chose to roll the die will select random numbers.
